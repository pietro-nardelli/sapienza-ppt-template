## Introduction
This is a **unofficial** slide template for La Sapienza, University of Rome :star:.

It is developed on [google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/0/), therefore compatibility with Microsoft Power Point is not assured :sleepy:. 
A template example can be seen [here](https://github.com/pietro-nardelli/sapienza-ppt-template/blob/main/sapienza-ppt-template.pdf). 
This is intended to be a simple yet complete template, however feel free to make it your own :v:.

## How to use it
There are two possibilities:
- Generate a copy of the template [in google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t6adiSpkEV6RKvrBBEbmBLQuyo7_mFRGFxlDhTsd0gg/edit?usp=sharing).
- Simply download the repository and open your `.pptx` or `.odp` file with your favourite software.
